# Play Trade üìà

Play Trade is an app that simulates the trading of stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and precious metals.

This is a simulation of course and users will be using play/pretend money.

Play Trade‚Äôs beauty lies in its simplicity ‚Äì no email is required on signup ‚Äì just create a username and password and start trading right away.

See if you can create a winning investment strategy today!

This app uses the [Yahoo Finance API](https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com/) which provides the latest quotes, trending stocks, detailed company histories, and more.

I decided to develop this app in order to more thoroughly examine subjects I have already studied: Redux, Redux Toolkit, React Router, advanced authentication/validation, etc.

Currently, this app is in the very early stages of development.

The visual design aspect was completed using the generic dashboard and login templates from the [latest bootstrap examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/).

Now that those tedious styling details are finally out of the way, it‚Äôs time for the fun part - implementing program functionality.

Again, this app is in the very early stages of development. As a result, you may notice peculiar choices in the source right now like massive components or using px instead of rem.

This will all be remedied shortly as I start to actually implement the programming logic.

Please check back again soon.

Thanks for your time üëç.
